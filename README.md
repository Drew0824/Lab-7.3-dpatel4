# In-state vs Out-of-state Bill

The University of South by Southwest charges $3000 per semester for in-state tuition and $4500 per semester for out-of-state tuition. In addition, room and board is $2500 per semester for in-state students and $3500 per semester for out-of-state students. 

Write a program that first prompts the user for their residential status. You can use a prompt like this and store their answer as an integer.

**Enter 1 for in-state residency or 2 for out-of-state:**

Then ask them whether they require room and board. You can use a prompt like this and store their answer as an integer.

**Enter 1 if you need room and board or 2 for no room and board:**

The program should then compute and output their bill for that semester. A sample program has been started for you that shows how the `&&` operator can be used in an `if` statement. 

Here are two sample runs of the program for two different inputs:

*Sample Run 1:*

Enter 1 for in-state residency or 2 for out-of-state: **1**
Enter 1 for if you need room and board or 2 for no room and board: **2**
Your total bill for this semester is $3000

*Sample Run 2: *

Enter 1 for in-state residency or 2 for out-of-state: **2**
Enter 1 for if you need room and board or 2 for no room and board: **1**
Your total bill for this semester is $8000
